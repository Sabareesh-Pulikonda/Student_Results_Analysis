# Student Marks Analysis Project

## Overview
The **Student Marks Analysis Project** aims to analyze student performance data to uncover insights that can help improve educational outcomes. The project demonstrates expertise in data handling, statistical analysis, visualization, and machine learning-based predictive modeling. This work is a valuable tool for educators to understand and address student performance challenges effectively.

## Features
- **Data Exploration**: Understanding the distribution and characteristics of the data.
- **Visualization**: Using charts and plots to gain insights into trends and correlations.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Leveraging machine learning techniques to forecast future performance and identify students at risk.

## Dataset
The dataset includes information such as:
- **Student ID**
- **Total Marks**
- **Performance Percentages**
- **Subject-wise Scores** (e.g., Math, Science, English)
- **Additional Features**

### Source
The data is stored in a file named `Expanded_data_with_more_features.csv`, which contains detailed information about each student's performance and associated attributes.

### Structure
- **CSV File**: Expanded data with multiple features.
- **Notebook**: The analysis, exploration, and modeling scripts are written in Python and stored in the Jupyter notebook `Project_student_Marks.ipynb`.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries Used**:
  - `Pandas`: Data manipulation and preprocessing
  - `NumPy`: Numerical computations
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`: Data visualization
  - `Scikit-learn`: Machine learning modeling
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for running the analysis

## Steps to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook file (`Project_student_Marks.ipynb`).
3. Load the dataset by running the appropriate cell.
4. Execute subsequent cells to explore, visualize, and predict student performance.

## Key Visualizations
The notebook provides:
- **Bar charts**: Subject-wise performance comparisons
- **Heatmaps**: Correlation among features
- **Line plots**: Trends in performance percentages

## Predictive Model
- Model Type: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine
- Input Features: Subject scores, total marks, etc.
- Output: Predicted performance or classification (e.g., pass/fail).

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporating more advanced models for improved predictions.
- Adding real-time data integration capabilities.
- Building a user-friendly dashboard for educators.

## Conclusion
The project provides actionable insights into student performance data, enabling educators to make informed decisions. It serves as a foundation for further developments in educational analytics.
